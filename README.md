# deep-learning-nd
Collection of completed projects from Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). All starter code, helper scripts ("helper.py" and "problem_unittests.py"), and data are provided by Udacity. The original project files can be found at the program's [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning).

Projects:  
1. Your first neural network  
   * Build and train a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.  
2. Image Classification  
   * Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
3. Generate TV scripts  
   * Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate new scripts for The Simpsons.  
4. Translate a Language  
   * Use a Sequence-to-Sequence RNN to translate sentences from English to French.  
5. Face Generation
   * Use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new images of faces.
